# bundestagsprotokolle-to-csv
XQuery scripts to translate parts of the protocols of the German Parliament to csv. This
works best with the great XML database [BaseX](https://basex.org/).

The XML files are available on the [open data website](https://www.bundestag.de/services/opendata)
 of the German Parliament.
